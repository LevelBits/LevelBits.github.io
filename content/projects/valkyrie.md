Ren√©e Brinkerhoff is an American auto-racing driver currently competing in the Mexican open road race, La Carrera Panamericana (LCP) and vintage races. Her racing experience began two years ago in the 2013 La Carrera Panamericana. And what a debut! Renee finished the race first in her class, becoming the only woman to ever do so in a La Carrera Panamericana debut. She is currently peparing for the 2016 rally with an eye on another first-in-class showing and an overall top-ten finish.
