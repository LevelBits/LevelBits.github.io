***

We are a Colorado based company that understands the current market. Our services are focused on saving clients time and money in regards to their waste and recycling service. We take pride in adding to other companies’ success! Ascent follows a gainsharing business model. If we do not generate 10% growth savings, the customer does not pay anything. If we don’t produce, we should not be paid. We are confident in our capabilities. With multiple years in the industry, we have the capabilities to improve any waste and recycling system. These improvements do not compromise service or service levels. Our main focus is reducing costs and increasing efficiency.
